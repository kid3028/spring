/**
 * 定义request与handler之间的映射关系
 * 框架内部已经有实现： {@link BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping} {@link RequestMappingHandlerMapping}
 * HandlerMapping实现需要支持拦截器，但是不是必须的。一个handler将会被包装为一个
 * {@link HandlerExecutionChain},可能伴随着一系列的{@link HandlerInterceptor}。
 * DispatcherServlet将首先顺序调用每一个 {@link HandlerInterceptor#preHandle(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, Object)},
 * 如果都返回true，那么将调用handler自身。
 *
 * mapping处理器还拥有非常强大的参数化能力。例如可以根据session状态、cookie状态
 * 或者其他的变量来实现自定义的mapping映射。
 *
 * 子类可以实现{@link org.springframework.core.Ordered}接口指定顺序，默认情况
 * 将会按照最低优先级处理。
 *
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that define a mapping between
 * requests and handler objects.
 *
 * <p>This class can be implemented by application developers, although this is not
 * necessary, as {@link BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping}
 * and {@link RequestMappingHandlerMapping}
 * are included in the framework. The former is the default if no
 * HandlerMapping bean is registered in the application context.
 *
 * <p>HandlerMapping implementations can support mapped interceptors but do not
 * have to. A handler will always be wrapped in a {@link HandlerExecutionChain}
 * instance, optionally accompanied by some {@link HandlerInterceptor} instances.
 * The DispatcherServlet will first call each HandlerInterceptor's
 * {@code preHandle} method in the given order, finally invoking the handler
 * itself if all {@code preHandle} methods have returned {@code true}.
 *
 * <p>The ability to parameterize this mapping is a powerful and unusual
 * capability of this MVC framework. For example, it is possible to write
 * a custom mapping based on session state, cookie state or many other
 * variables. No other MVC framework seems to be equally flexible.
 *
 * <p>Note: Implementations can implement the {@link org.springframework.core.Ordered}
 * interface to be able to specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting
 * applied by DispatcherServlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.
